# Graph Theory Visualiser

A web application to create graphs and run algorithms on them.

## Features

- **Vertex and Edge Creation**: Create a graph by adding vertices and drawing edges between them.
- **Vertex Deletion**: Delete a vertex and all edges that connect to it by double-clicking a vertex.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Run algorithms like DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's on the graph you have created.

## Installation

Clone the repository using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebslape/Graph-Theory-Visualiser.git
cd Graph-Theory-Visualiser
```

## Usage

Open index.html in a web browser.

### Editing Nodes

To create a node, click anywhere on the graph where you want the node to be.
To delete a node, double click on the node you want to delete. This will also remove any edges that are connected to the node.

### Running Algorithms

To run the desired algorithm, click on the corresponding button on the top of the screen.
